# Selenium and Python Contact Form Testing

## Overview

This program automates the testing of a web form using Selenium. It offers a simple interface for entering test data into a contact form and subsequently validating the test's success. The purpose is to demonstrate automated testing using Selenium.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Selenium
- Chrome

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Python if you haven't already: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Install the Selenium package: `pip install selenium`.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Fill in the test data as prompted.
3. Wait for the program to finish testing (typically takes a few minutes).
4. Check the terminal for the test result message.

## Download Executable

You can download the executable file from https://drive.google.com/file/d/10zvBLN5KVpW3y5LnfYemSCAKLISR8zwZ/view?usp=share_link.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement an error logging system.
2. Make better use of functions with the aim of being able to reuse the code with minimal coding for other test cases.
3. Create separate test cases for different scenarios, such as handling invalid input.

## Notes

Feel free to test the contact form as much as you want. The form is on my personal blog.
